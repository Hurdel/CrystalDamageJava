# CrystalDamage
This Plugin controlls the damage from shields taken by End-Crystal-Explosions.

#### Version:
1.19.4 *(1.19 - 1.19.4 tested)*

## The Idee:
The Idea for this project came from this pluginrequest on the bukkit.org forums <https://bukkit.org/threads/end-crystal-damage.500753/>

## Commands:

* /crystaldamage set [insert value between 0 and 100]
  * You can change the damage with this command.
  * When it set to 0, the shield will take no damage from End-Crystal-Explosions, when set to 100 it will take 100% of its durability in Damage and everything in between should be self explanatory.
  * If you change the value in the File (CrystalDamage.yml), you must reload the plugins, so it takes the new value.
* /crystaldamage query
  * You get the current value of the percentage of damage to the shields as response.
  
*The commands can be only be used by the Players how are OP.*
